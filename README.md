# All Together Information System (ATIS)

## Overview

All Together Information System is a Java-based application designed to facilitate community-driven collaboration.
The platform enables members of a community to request assistance with tasks, and allows other members to volunteer to help with them.
Each community is overseen by a single community manager who has access to detailed information on completed tasks, including histograms and reports.

The application was implemented using OCSF, JavaFX, mySQL and more.
